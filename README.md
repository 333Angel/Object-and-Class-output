# Object-and-Class-output
Basic Java code that prints out a multiple choice question and determines whether the user puts in the correct input

This was made for one of my School Assignments! I have this here so I can reuse the code if I wish but It's also here to document my own assignments, programs, and so that others are free to learn or use this program. 

I have comments directly in my program and files to make it clear what parts of it do.
